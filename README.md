# Aim of the project
In today’s fast-paced society, finding the perfect dining spot can be a daunting task amidst
the vast sea of options available. Fortunately, technology comes to our rescue with innovative
solutions like content-based filtering. Our project aims to design and develop a restaurant
recommendation system that leverages the power of content-based filtering techniques to
provide personalized and accurate suggestions to users. By analyzing the unique preferences,
tastes, and characteristics of both restaurants and users, our system promises to deliver
tailored top ten restaurant recommendations, ensuring an enhanced dining experience for
every individual. So, join us as we dive into the realm of content-based filtering and explore
the endless possibilities it offers in revolutionizing the way we discover and enjoy culinary
delights.
# Methodology
The content-based restaurant recommendation system, utilizing the Zomato dataset, follows
a comprehensive methodology to provide personalized suggestions. Initially, unnecessary
columns are identified and removed, streamlining the dataset for efficient analysis. Duplicates are then eliminated to ensure data integrity and accuracy. The subsequent step
involves removing NaN values, minimizing any potential bias or distortion in the recommendations. To enhance readability and clarity, column names are modified, facilitating better
comprehension of the dataset’s attributes. Next, data transformations are performed to
prepare the dataset for analysis. Text preprocessing steps are implemented, such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword elimination, and URL removal. These actions help
extract meaningful information from the textual data, eliminating noise and enhancing the
quality of the recommendations. Additionally, spelling correction techniques are applied to
improve the accuracy of the textual content. Furthermore, to provide a user-friendly interface for the content-based restaurant recommendation system, the deployment of a graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented using Streamlit. Through the Streamlit-powered
user interface, users can access the full functionality of the content-based restaurant recommendation system effortlessly. Finally, a crucial aspect of the content-based restaurant
recommendation system is the development of a function that generates recommendations.
By utilizing various features, such as cuisine type, location, user preferences, and restaurant
characteristics, the function identifies restaurants that align closely with the user’s preferences. This approach ensures that the recommendations are tailored to each user’s specific
tastes and requirements, enhancing the overall dining experience. In summary, this content-based restaurant recommendation system, employing the Zomato dataset, employs a
systematic approach encompassing data cleaning, text preprocessing, and personalized
recommendation generation. By leveraging these methodologies, the system assists users in
discovering restaurants that best match their individual preferences, revolutionizing the way
they explore and enjoy culinary delights.

of culinary experiences. Overall, the content-based restaurant recommendation system
serves as a valuable tool across various domains, enriching user experiences, promoting
exploration, and facilitating informed decision-making.

# Timeline
Stage 1 Base structure including collecitng the data, researching
about the project and considering the feasibility to use
our preferred recommendation system technique.
Stage 2 Implementing the RS with our data, shortening the data
to see if that improves our time to test out bugs etc.
Also includes cleaning the data.
Stage 3 testing the system for corretc outputs and with different
input data and also the performance with the full
data file that included over 54k records.
Stage 4 Implementing the system with streamlit so that the project
has a prettier face and an easier to read interface, testing
out final bugs also included in this stage.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the development of the content-based restaurant recommendation system
using the Zomato dataset has showcased its potential to revolutionize the way individuals
discover and enjoy dining experiences. Through a systematic approach encompassing data
cleaning, text preprocessing, and personalized recommendation generation, the system
offers tailored suggestions based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and location. By
leveraging the power of content filtering techniques, the system enhances user experiences,
providing personalized and accurate recommendations that align with individual tastes and
requirements. The real-world applications of this project are vast, benefiting not only
individuals seeking personalized dining experiences but also the food and hospitality industry,
tourists, event planners, online review platforms, and food bloggers/influencers. By
integrating the system into various platforms and interfaces, businesses can enhance
customer satisfaction, engagement, and revenue generation, while users can explore new
culinary delights and make informed dining choices. Moreover, the deployment of a
user-friendly interface using Streamlit has improved the accessibility and usability of the
recommendation system, allowing users to interact seamlessly and effortlessly with the
system’s functionalities. The graphical user interface empowers users to input their
preferences, view restaurant details, and access personalized recommendations in an
intuitive and visually appealing manner. As the demand for personalized experiences
continues to grow, the content-based restaurant recommendation system represents a
valuable solution that leverages data-driven insights to transform the way individuals
discover, select, and enjoy restaurants. By combining the power of data analysis, text
preprocessing, and user-centric design, this project lays the foundation for a future where
dining experiences are enriched, personalized, and tailored to individual preferences, making
every meal an unforgettable adventure.
